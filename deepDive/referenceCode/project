You are working in the cloud infrastructure and configuration Team and as such
your team is working on migrating a multi tiers app fully hosted on aws.
A lot have been done already in terms of inventory the app, planning ,approval of cost, designing the architecture for aws,
and your team is now at the phase of creating the infrastructure in aws.
The project is broken down into user's stories or tickets. and these tickets are in the kanban board (jira software):
Go ahead and solve these tickets; dont hesitate to bring up any questions that you have during our morning stand up meetings.

<!-- TODO 1 -->
1- Create a vpc for utc app with below specs:
• name: utc-app
• Tenancy: default
• NAT Gateway: 1
• s3 endpoint: no
• CIDR: 172.120.0.0/16
• enable IPV6: No
• Enable DNS hostnames: yes
• Enable DNS resolution: yes
• Internet Gateway name: dev-wdp-IGW
• Attach the Internet Gateway to the VPC
• two public subnets
• two private subnets
tags: 
Name: utc-app1
env: dev 
team: wdp
created by: Yourname 


<!-- TODO 2 -->
2- Create a security group for utc app: 
name: webserver-sg
ports:
• 22 for ssh, allow just from your ip
    • 80 for apache, open to the world
        • 8080 open everywhere vpc: utc-app1


<!-- TODO 3 -->
3- create a ssh keypair for utc app: 
name: utc-key 
format: pem


<!-- TODO 4 -->
4- create an ec2 instance with below specs: 
ami: ẫmi-0195204d5dce06d99
hardrive / ebs: 20g
security group: webserver-sg 
enable public ip: yes 
key_name: utc-key 
vpc: utc-app1
subnet: public-subnet-1a 
user data:
#!/bin/bash
sudo yum update -y 
sudo groupadd docker
sudo useradd John -aG docker 
sudo yum install git unzip wget httpd -y 
sudo systemctl start httpd 
sudo systemctl enable httpd 
sudo cd /opt sudo wget https://github.com/kserge2001/web-

tags = {
Name: utc-dev-inst
Team: Cloud Transformation
Environment: Dev
Created by: your name goes here
}


<!-- TODO 5 -->
5- testing:
check the vpc and subnets check the keypair check the security group
check the instance (login and verify that user data run)
Take the ip address of the instance to the browser to verify content

<!-- TODO 6 -->
6- create an ami of your utc-dev-inst so next time we dont need to reconfigure the instance. call it utc-dev-inst


<!-- TODO 7 -->
7- clean-up
terminate the instance delete security group delete keypair delete vpc


<!-- TODO 8 -->
8- Start effort to automate this using terraform.


<!-- TODO 9 -->
9- create an s3 bucket for the state file and a dynamodb table for the state file lock.


<!-- TODO 10 -->
10- push the code to github after testing
